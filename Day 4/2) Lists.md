# Python List Data Structure

- Data structure: A way of organizing and storing data. 
- Storing single pieces of data is done with *variables*.

      a = 3
      b = "hello"
    
- To store grouped pieces of data that have connections with each other you can use a *List*.
- EX: All 50 states in United States of America. 
  - Doesn't make sense to store names of states individually. 
  - All states are related to each other. 
  - You can place states in certain order. 
  
## List
- Set of square brackets with many items stored inside.
- The items can be any data type.
  - Mixed data types allowed. Like strings together with numbers or booleans.
EX:

    fruits = [item1, item2. item3]
