    - A function is a block of code with a name.
    - We can call a function by its name. 
    - The code inside a function only runs when it's called.
    - A function can accept data from the caller program, it's called as function parameters.
    - The function parameters are inside parentheses and separated by a comma.
      - A function can accept any number of arguments.
    - A function can return data to the caller program.
      - Unline other popular programming languages, Python functions definition doesn't specify return type.
    - Can't use reserved keywords as function name.



## How to Define a Function?
- Use **def** keyword to define a function.
- def function_name(arguments):
      # code statements

"""
def hello():
  print("Hello World!")

def add(x, y):
  print(f"arguments are {x} and {y}")
  return x + y
"""
