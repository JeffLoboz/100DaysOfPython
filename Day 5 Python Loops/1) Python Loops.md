# Python Loops

## for Loop

- Used to iterate over a sequence of items.
- Implemented using the reserved keyword **for**.
- for-loop code is executed for each *element* of the sequence.
- Get out of the for loop using the **break** statement.
- Use **continue** statement to skip the execution of the code in the for loop for an element.
- Python for loop is different from other programming languages as it behaves more like an **iterator**.
- Use for loop to iterate over **Tuple**, **List**, **Set**, or **String**.
  - All of these objects are a sequence in Python.
- We can have **nested for loops** to iterate over a sequence of sequences. 

## for Loop Syntax
- Uses  **in** operator to iterate over the elementes in the sequence.

      for element in sequence::
        # for statement code block
