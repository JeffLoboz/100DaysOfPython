# Python while Loop

    - Python while loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is **False**
    - The while loop is used when we don't know the number of times the code block has to execute.
    - *CAUTION* If the condition never returns False, the while loop will go into the **infinite loop**.
    - **Every object in Python has a boolean value.**
      - If the value is 0 or None, then the boolean value is False.
      - Otherwise, the bookean value is True.
    - Define an objects boolean value by implementing __bool__() function. 
    - Use reserverd keyword **while** to implement while loop.
    - Terminate while loop using the **break** statement. 
    - Use continue statement inside while loop to skip the code block execution. 
    - Python supports nested while loops.
