# What is Python Namespace?
    Python namespaces are containers to map names to objects.
    In Python, Everything is an object and we specify a name to the object so that we can access it later.

    Namespaces are like a dictionary of key-value pairs. The key is the variable and the value is the object associated with it. 
    namespace = {"name1":object1, "name2":object2}

    In python, multiple namespaces can exist at same time. 
    Variable names can be reused in these namespaces.
    function_namespace = {"name1":object1, "name2":object2}
    for_loop_namespace = {"name1":object3, "name2":object4}

    Example with multiple namespaces.
